## GIMP Plugin For Integration With Meta Segment Anything

> **Fork notice:** This is a fork of [Shriinivas/gimpsegany](https://github.com/Shriinivas/gimpsegany) with macOS Apple Silicon support and UI improvements. See [What's new in this fork](#whats-new-in-this-fork).

This GIMP plugin integrates with Meta's AI-based tool Segment Anything, which enables you to effortlessly isolate objects within raster images directly from GIMP.

The plugin supports both **Segment Anything 1 (SAM1)** and **Segment Anything 2 (SAM2)** — including SAM 2.1 checkpoints.

---

## What's new in this fork

- **Apple Silicon / MPS support** — SAM2 models load and run on macOS Apple Silicon via PyTorch's MPS backend. Falls back to CUDA, then CPU.
- **SAM1 imports are optional** — the bridge no longer requires `segment_anything` to be installed when you only use SAM2.
- **SAM 2.1 checkpoints** — the bridge auto-detects `sam2.1_*` checkpoint filenames and loads the matching configs from `configs/sam2.1/`.
- **Editable path fields** — the Python and Checkpoint path fields in the plugin dialog accept typed/pasted paths (Entry + Browse button) instead of being limited to a file picker. The browse dialog also shows hidden files, which is required to reach `~/Library` on macOS.
- **Persistent backend** — the bridge runs as a long-living subprocess and caches the loaded model. The first segmentation pays the model-load cost; subsequent ones skip it (≈8× faster on Apple Silicon).
- **Hugging Face Hub support** — instead of a local `.pt` path you can paste a HF id like `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-large` into the Checkpoint field. Requires `pip install huggingface_hub` in the SAM environment.

## Installation

### Quick install (macOS)

Clone this repo, then run:

```bash
bash install.command
```

It creates (or reuses) a `sam2` conda env, installs PyTorch / OpenCV / huggingface_hub / sam2, copies `seganyplugin.py` and `seganybridge.py` into the right GIMP plug-ins folder, and seeds a default `segany_settings.json` pointing at `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-large` on Hugging Face — so the first run in GIMP works without any extra configuration. The script is idempotent and preserves an existing settings file.

Requirements: GIMP 3 already installed, and Miniforge/Miniconda on your `PATH` (https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

Then restart GIMP and use `Image → Segment Anything Layers`. The first segmentation downloads the SAM 2.1 Large weights from Hugging Face (~900 MB, cached under `~/.cache/huggingface`); the GIMP status bar shows the download and load progress.

If something goes wrong, click **Run Setup Check** in the plugin dialog — it verifies the interpreter, PyTorch + device, sam2, and the checkpoint load in one go and points at the exact missing piece.

### Manual install

If you prefer to set things up by hand (Linux, Windows, or a custom environment), follow the sections below.

#### 1. Plugin files

Copy this repo's `seganyplugin.py` and `seganybridge.py` into a `seganyplugin` folder inside GIMP's user plug-ins directory:

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.x\plug-ins\seganyplugin\`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/GIMP/3.x/plug-ins/seganyplugin/`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/3.x/plug-ins/seganyplugin/`

Replace `3.x` with the minor version that matches your GIMP install (e.g. `3.2`). You can find the exact path under `Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-ins`. On Linux and macOS, `chmod +x seganyplugin.py`.

#### 2. Python environment

Create a Python environment with the SAM2 backend. On macOS the bundled `environment-macos.yml` is the easiest path:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-macos.yml
conda activate sam2
SAM2_BUILD_CUDA=0 pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git
```

On Linux with CUDA, follow Meta's instructions at https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2 and also `pip install opencv-python huggingface_hub`.

For SAM1 support (optional), additionally run `pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git` and download one of the `sam_vit_*.pth` checkpoints.

#### 3. Point the plugin at it

Open GIMP, then `Image → Segment Anything Layers`, and set:

- **Python3 Path** — the interpreter with SAM2 installed (e.g. `/opt/miniconda3/envs/sam2/bin/python`). The **Detect…** button lists conda envs it finds automatically.
- **Model Source** — pick one of the curated SAM 2.1 entries to load via Hugging Face, or choose *Custom checkpoint* and point at a local `.pt` / `.safetensors`.

Click **Run Setup Check** to verify the combo works before running a real segmentation. Values are persisted to `segany_settings.json` next to the plugin files.

## Plugin Usage

### Dialog options

At the top of the dialog, the **Preset** bar lets you save the current option combo under a name and reload it later. *Save as…* snapshots everything below (except the python interpreter, which is machine-specific) into `segany_settings.json`; *Delete* removes the active preset.

**Interpreter & model:**

- **Python3 Path** — the python used to run `seganybridge.py`. Type/paste a path, click *Browse…*, or click *Detect…* to pick from conda envs found under `~/miniconda3/envs`, `~/anaconda3/envs`, `~/mambaforge/envs`, `~/miniforge3/envs`, plus Homebrew/system python3s.
- **Model Source** — curated Hugging Face presets (SAM 2.1 Large / Base+ / Small / Tiny). Picking one fills *Checkpoint Path* with the HF id and aligns *Model Type*; on first run the weights are downloaded via `huggingface_hub` and cached under `~/.cache/huggingface`. Choose *— Custom checkpoint —* to point at a local file instead.
- **Model Type** — `Auto` infers from the checkpoint name (`sam_*` → SAM1, `sam2*` / `sam2.1*` → SAM2). Override when auto-detection picks the wrong variant.
- **Model Checkpoint** — either a full path to a `.pt` / `.pth` / `.safetensors` file, or a Hugging Face repo id like `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-large`.

**Segmentation:**

- **Segmentation Type:**
  - **Auto** — segments the entire image.
  - **Box** — segments objects inside a rectangular selection.
  - **Selection** — segments objects seeded by sample points drawn from the current selection.
- **Mask Type:**
  - **Multiple** — one layer per candidate mask.
  - **Single** — only the highest-scoring mask.
- **Selection Points** (Selection mode only) — how many seed points to sample from the current selection.

**SAM2-specific options (Auto segmentation):**

- **Segmentation Resolution** — auto-segmentation grid density. Higher = more masks, slower.
- **Crop n Layers** — run segmentation on overlapping crops for better small-object recall.
- **Minimum Mask Area** — drop masks smaller than this many pixels.

**Output:**

- **Random Mask Color** / **Mask Color** — colorize each mask layer randomly, or with a single fixed color.
- **Auto-select from top mask** (on by default) — after segmentation, hide the mask group and replace the GIMP selection with the best mask, so you can crop / copy / paint against it directly. Turn off to inspect all masks and pick one by hand.

**Run Setup Check** — launches the bridge in test mode with the current interpreter and checkpoint and reports a checklist (python, torch + device, sam2, checkpoint loads, test inference passes). Failed checks surface the actionable hint from the translation table instead of a raw traceback. Use this first whenever a run fails.

### Workflow

1. Pick your options (or load a preset) and click *OK*.
2. The GIMP status bar shows progress: *Loading model…* (or the HF download warning on first run) → *Running … segmentation…*. The first segmentation pays the model-load cost; subsequent ones with the same checkpoint reuse the cached model and start in under a second.
3. **Default (Auto-select on):** the mask group is hidden and the top mask is already selected as a GIMP selection. Crop, copy, paint behind, or convert to a layer mask as usual.
4. **With Auto-select off:** the top mask layer is visible in a *Segment Anything – …* group; the other masks are created but hidden. Toggle visibility to pick a different one — layer names include their coverage percentage (`Mask - Box #1 (17.3%)`) to help.

## Troubleshooting

**Click *Run Setup Check* first.** It translates most install-time errors (missing `sam2`, missing `huggingface_hub`, missing `cv2`, MPS OOM, checkpoint/config mismatch, network errors) into an actionable hint with the exact `pip install` line you need. Run-time failures in the main dialog go through the same translator, so the error dialog already tells you what to fix in almost every case.

If *Run Setup Check* doesn't help, the common less-obvious failure modes are:

- **`Placeholder storage has not been allocated on MPS device`** — known SAM2/MPS issue on Apple Silicon. Workaround: force CPU by editing the top of `seganybridge.py`'s `_select_device()` to return `"cpu"`. Slower but always works.
- **`Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension`** during install — harmless on macOS; SAM2 falls back to its pure-PyTorch path.
- **GIMP does not list the plugin** — check `Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-ins`. The installer places files under `…/GIMP/3.x/plug-ins/seganyplugin/`, where `3.x` must match GIMP's minor version. On Linux/macOS the `.py` files must be executable.
- **Mask group is empty / only hidden layers** — you're on an older commit without the *Auto-select* default. Re-run `install.command` or copy the latest `seganyplugin.py` into the plug-ins folder.
